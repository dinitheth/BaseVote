- Accent color: Deep purple (#A020F0) to highlight interactive elements and important information, providing a good contrast against the electric blue.
- Body and headline font: 'Space Grotesk', a proportional sans-serif with a computerized, techy, scientific feel.
- Use minimalist icons representing blockchain, voting, and statistics to maintain a clean and modern interface.
- A clean and intuitive layout with clear sections for wallet input, proposals, stats, and theme toggle. Use grid or flexbox for responsiveness.
